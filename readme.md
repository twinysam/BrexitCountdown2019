# Brexit Countdown 2019

 https://twinysam.github.io/BrexitCountdown2019/

A better (than I've seen out there) countdown website to the deadline for a Brexit deal (October 31st, 2019 at 11pm). For instance, I'm not using local time but UK time, so the countdown will be consistent regardless of your OS's time. And I'm keeping the design clean, simple and minimalistic.

## Wishlist of things I would like to add but probably never will

- [ ] A progress bar besides the clock countdown, maybe with a dancing Boris heading for the deadline. (No idea how to do it with moment.js and/or countdown.js)
- [ ] A ticker at the top with a Brexit newsfeed or Twitter feed (looked into both, couldn't find any simple solutions for either)
- [ ] Trigger an event when the countdown finishes. Could be a text, an image or something like that.
